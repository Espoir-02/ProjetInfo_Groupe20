# Second-year Computer Science Project: Internship Search Assistance

The internship search, an essential step for every student, can quickly turn into an administrative and time-consuming maze for those who are not well-organized: scouring company websites in search of internship offers, consulting the same job posting on different sites without realizing it, and no longer finding the list that was hastily written on a piece of paper can easily become the daily routine, particularly time-consuming, for any student new to the field.

Internship offer comparators, therefore, allow students to save time by centralizing data: all information is available in one place. By internship, we mean a training period within a private company or a public institution, determined by a field of expertise, a start and end date, and a salary (which can be zero).

Therefore, searching by criteria offers the possibility of finding proposals that exactly match the users' search, prioritizing the four essential questions of any search: when (dates), where (company), what (field), how much (salary).
